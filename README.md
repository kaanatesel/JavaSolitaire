# Solitaire in Java
Solitaire is a simple Java implementation of the classic one-player game. It allows the user to interact by clicking on cards and then clicking again on the spot to which a card or stack of cards can be moved.

I wrote this project for my high school Data Structures course. Solitaire specifically uses both Stacks and Lists in order to manage the many piles of cards that must be tracked; as an example, the main well from which cards are drawn uses simple "push" and "pop" operations in order to add or remove a card.

Although my teacher provided our class with the basic JFrame skeleton for playing the game, I myself modified the card art and various color schemes in order to make gameplay more enjoyable.


To run this simply use the run script contained within the root directory:
  
bash run.sh
